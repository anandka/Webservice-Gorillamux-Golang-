# Webservice-Gorillamux-Golang-
Web service to have handson over Gorillamux


Goals

1)	Write a REST API Server that provides GET, PUT and POST methods for Employee Data Management. You should use Gorilla Mux for it. 
2)	Create a custom Employee Struct with the following attributes:
        a.	Employee Id
        b.	Employee First Name
        c.	Employee Last Name
        d.	Date of Joining
e.	List of Skills (For e.g. Java, J2EE, etc). This should be a repeatable field so select the correct Golang type here.
3)	You can provide multiple methods in the REST API, where you can allow search by any of the attributes, etc. I leave it to your imagination.
4)	For this assignment we will stub the data i.e. hard code – so create dummy data and when records are added / edited / deleted – maintain them in an in-memory Map for now. 
5)	In the next assignment – you can hook it up to a MySQL Database or any other database , but don’t do this for now.
